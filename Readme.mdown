## About

I hate writing boilerplate code, and since I couldn't find any good templates
for getting a basic Sinatra app running, I decided to make my own.

The Sinatra/DataMapper template includes basic code to set up a database, a
simple user login system, a little bit of HTML/CSS, and other things that I
usually include in my Sinatra apps.
